The Oasis Network has a complex modular architecture that separates consensus and computing operations into two layers: Consensus and ParaTime. 

The first is a Proof-of-Stake protocol secured by a set of validators. 

The second represents many replicated computing environments or parallel runtimes (ParaTimes) with a shared state. Complex operations on one ParaTime don't affect transactions on other ParaTimes as they work simultaneously. 

Developers can deploy a ParaTime for a specific purpose with adjusted parameters. 


The guides below will show you the process of setting up the nodes on the Oasis Network:
